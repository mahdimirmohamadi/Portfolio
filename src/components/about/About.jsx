          I've been familiar with programming since 14. i started with PASCAL
          language(now that i'm writing it it sounds kinda weird to meðŸ˜‚)
        </p>
        <p className="a-desc">
          After that i learned Python and a little Django and since 2021 i
          entered Front-End web developing cause of several reasons:
          <ol>
            <li>
              I WANTED A JOB! (i know you were expecting something more
              Emotional. sorry about thatðŸ˜’)
            </li>
            <li>
              nothing was more enjoyable to me than Creating and Developing
              Websites. i could've sit hours and do coding without even noticing
              it(YES. just like FAIRYTALES ðŸ¦„)
            </li>
            <li>
              wasn't the first 2 reasons satisfyinf enough for you? what else is
              it that you're seeking so hard for?ðŸ˜‹
